This repository contains the scripts used for aligning reads and calling SNPs for resequenced individuals, running ANGSD, running PSMC and assembling mitogenomes

**Data**
-------------
Sequencing reads required to run the pipeline are available at the European Nucleotide Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser) under study accession PRJEB37295  
Genome assembly used in the pipeline is available on the [DNA ZOO](www.dnazoo.org/assemblies/Oryx_dammah) website. For this analysis, only the 29 chromosomal-level scaffolds were used. 

**Notes**
------------- 
`4.2_boot_PSMC.sh`, `6.1_angsdHet.sh` and `6.1_realSFS.sh` are designed to be run using the respective scripts: `run_4.2_boot_PSMC.sh`, `run_6.1_angsdHet.sh` and `run_6.1_realSFS.sh`.  
`/file_lists` contains text files required for running pipeline
